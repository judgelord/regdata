# regdata
A repository for important data sources on the regulatory state. Collaboration welcome. We need content for downloading and parsing content. Ideally, final output will be in the form of sqlite databases that can be easily shared and queried. What follows is notes on data sources that we know about and are working on acquiring.

## Federal Register

There are two important potential sources:

- XML bulk data is available from https://www.govinfo.gov/bulkdata/FR
- Federal Register API gives plain text back to 1994.

## Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions

XML versions available from 1995 until present

https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaXmlReport

## Regulations.gov (for comments)

Agencies that do not host comments on Regulations.gov:

- Federal Reserve System
- Federal Communications Commission

## Other Wish List Sources

- Meetings
